# Numbers

There are three different types of numbers:

* int (integers)
* float (floating point numbers)
* complex (complex numbers)

> NOTE: long was a number type in Python2 but has been deprecated in Python3

Integers are whole numbers and floats have a decimal point.

Integers:

* 1
* -4774197410171071081052052375
* 9088923958730527

Floats:

* 1.01
* -8.28280588973498572984569823645
* 7.2472722782958

Complex Numbers:

From what I've read, they're imaginary.  They have a j at the end like this, 4.7j.
> print(type(4.7j))
>
> <class 'complex'>

Maybe some of you will find a use for them if you're into advanced mathematics but I've personally never used them.

**Demonstration:**

Perform some basic calculations using integers and floats.  
Perform calculations using integers with strings.

**Assignment:**

Use the print statement and variables from Lesson 1.  Add add age variable.  Add your age to the print statement and how old you were when you started your job using variable with a calculation.

Example:

> Hello, my name is Dwight Schrute. I'm the Assistant to the Regional Manager at Dunder Mifflin and have been working here for 12 years.  I am currently 37 years old and started at Dunder Mifflin when I was 25 years old.
