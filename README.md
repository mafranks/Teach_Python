# Teach_Python

This repo is going to contain the file I'm creating to teach an introduction to Python.  There will be no knowledge requirement going into this, except I am not going to explain how to install Python.  I'm sure you can figure out how to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install](https://docs.python.org/3/) it yourself.

If any additional files are required for the lessons, they will be included along with the scripts I end up creating.

We'll deal with troubleshooting along the way because I, like you, make mistakes.
