# Teach_Python

This repo is going to contain the Jupyter notebook(s) that I'm creating to teach an introduction to Python.  There will be no knowledge requirement going into this but I am not going to explain how to install Python.  I'm sure you can figure out how to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install](https://docs.python.org/3/) it yourself.

Since the lessons are in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format, you may also want to read a little about that but it won't be required knowledge for the lessons.

If any additional files are required for the lessons, they will be included along with the Jupyter Notebook file.
