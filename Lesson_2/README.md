# Variable Types

In Lesson 1, we printed out some strings.  Some of those were typed by us and some of them were stored in variables.
Printing is useful for displaying information to the user and also for providing some quick feedback while troubleshooting.
We can see that our variables are strings by using the type() function.

> NOTE: In IDLE, you could just use ```type(name)``` but I want to get in the habit of using ```print(type(name))``` because I'll shortly be transitioning to the Visual Studio Code IDE where using ```type(name)``` will produce an error.

As you can see, our variable has a type of string.  What other variable types are there?  Python has five standard data types.  Let's take a quick look at all five. We'll cover them all over the course of the next few lessons.

* Strings
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Tuples
* Numbers 


**Demonstration:**

Show examples of strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples and numbers.  Use ```type()``` to prove it.

> "Michael Scott"
>
> ["Michael Scott", "Dwight Schrute", "Angela Martin"]
>
> {"name": "Michael Scott", "title": "Regional Manager", "branch": "Scranton"}
>
> ("Michael Scott", "Dwight Schrute")
>
> 191
